- 👋 Hi, I’m @prabhat-123.
- I am a ML Engineer with 4+ years of experience in predictive analytics, time series and computer vision. Passionate about data who loves:
1) Researching and Carrying out experiments with data and models,
2) Designing and Engineering systems capable of machine learning,
3) Deploying ML models into production, maintaining and upgrading models over time.

Achievements include:
1) Speeding up the data fetching pipelines of NetApp by 15 times by using concurrent programming(multithreading) in our pipeline to fetch one million records within 16 hours which would take 11 days previously.
2) Increased the number of api calls by more than 70% by deploying 24 new apis into production and improve invoice extraction accuracy to 95%.
3) Worked with a team of 3 members to create a minimum viable product(MVP) for Rubicon-Time Series.

Highly skilled in machine learning, data visualization, computer vision and NLP with a solid grasp of statistics, analysis and creative thinking.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer vision research particularly in sports analytics, pose estimation, medical imaging and so on.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data engineering, data science and computer vision.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects associated with machine learning and computer vision.
